/**
* \brief A class to control the viewing parameters.
*
* This class maintains and provides access to parameters of a simple viewing model,
* and it supports basic viewing operations like translation, rotation, and zooming.
* The view parameters are:
*		- The view point (where the camera is located)
*		- The view center (a point that is being looked at; the closer it is to the
*		   view point, the greater the degree of zooming)
*		- The up vector (defines the global vertical axis; typically this is the y axis)
*		- The field of view (defined as the vertical angular span of the viewing
*		   frustrum in radians
*		- The aspect ratio (the ratio width/height for the resultant image)
